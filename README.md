**A Modular React Native Playground (Expo + TypeScript)**

MiniLab is a **feature-driven React Native application** built to practice and demonstrate **core mobile development concepts** through small, focused, real-world mini features.

## What this project demonstrates

- **Core React Native concepts**  
  State management (`useState`, `useEffect`), navigation, side-effects, gestures, animations, audio, haptics, and API integration.

- **Hands-on mini features (logic + UI focused)**  
  Each screen is designed to solve a specific problem while keeping the UI clean and professional.

- **Production-ready UI fundamentals**  
  Reusable components, consistent theming, defensive error handling, and Expo-safe libraries.

## Why MiniLab?

> Instead of building one large app, MiniLab focuses on **understanding fundamentals deeply** by implementing multiple small features — each targeting a specific mobile development concept.

This makes it ideal as a **learning project**, **internship portfolio**, or **concept reference app**.
